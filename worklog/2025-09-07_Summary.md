# Work Summary - September 7, 2025

## Overview
Focused day on test refactoring and documentation. Improved E2E test reliability, enhanced error handling patterns in test utilities, and documented historical work from late August.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. E2E Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **Test Reliability Enhancement**:
  - Replaced dynamic ID fetching with predictable `testJobApplication` IDs in application table tests
  - Improved test stability by using deterministic test data for filtering and editing operations
  - Enhanced readability and maintainability of test cases
  - Better separation between test data setup and test execution

- **Test Helper Refinement**:
  - Updated `unwrapJobApp` helper to use `match` pattern for better error handling
  - Improved clarity in handling Result types from job application operations
  - Enhanced comment documentation for ID field behavior during updates

### 2. Code Quality and Linting
- **Biome Configuration**:
  - Updated biome-ignore comments in E2E fixtures (`tests/e2e/fixtures/base.ts`)
  - Removed unnecessary lint ignore comments
  - Added relevant comments for code correctness
  - Ensured consistent linting across test files

### 3. Project Maintenance
- **Settings Formatting**:
  - Reformatted local settings JSON file for consistency
  - Adjusted indentation to ensure uniform formatting across configuration files

- **Historical Documentation**:
  - Created detailed work summaries for August 26-28, 2025
  - Documented project setup, core domain development, and workflow enhancements
  - Included achievements, modified files, and configuration updates
  - Highlighted key patterns: repository pattern, Page Object Model, and job application form implementation

## Technical Details

### Commits
- 5 commits total
- All commits: chore (maintenance and refactoring)
- Focus areas: Testing (3), Documentation (1), Configuration (1)

### Code Quality Patterns
- **Error Handling**: Adopted `match` pattern for Result types instead of direct unwrapping
- **Test Data Management**: Shifted to predictable test fixtures for improved reliability
- **Documentation**: Retroactive documentation of architectural decisions and implementation patterns

### Testing Improvements
- Enhanced E2E test determinism by eliminating dynamic ID lookups
- Improved test helper functions with better error reporting
- Cleaner test code with improved readability

## Impact
- **Test Reliability**: More stable E2E tests with predictable behavior
- **Developer Experience**: Clearer test utilities and better error messages
- **Maintainability**: Improved code formatting consistency and linting rules
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Historical documentation provides context for architectural decisions
