# Work Summary - October 21, 2025

## Overview
Major framework migration from Bun server to ElysiaJS, along with significant improvements to test infrastructure and code organization. This work focused on architectural modernization and enhanced developer experience.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Framework Migration to ElysiaJS
- **Server Migration**: Replaced Bun server implementation with Elysia framework
  - Introduced plugin-based architecture for improved modularity
  - Added `@elysiajs/static` for static asset serving
  - Integrated `@elysiajs/swagger` for automatic API documentation
  - Created custom route plugins for applications and pages
  - Enhanced overall server performance and maintainability

### 2. Testing Infrastructure Enhancements
- **Keyboard Navigation Testing**:
  - Added comprehensive keyboard navigation tests for edit forms
  - Introduced `sendTabUntilFocused` and `sendShiftTabUntilFocused` helper functions
  - Added tests for Enter key submission and Escape key cancellation
  - Created `pressKeyUntilFocused` utility for streamlined keyboard navigation testing
  - Integrated helpers into `application-table.spec.ts` to reduce redundancy
  - Enhanced test clarity and maintainability for keyboard-focused scenarios

### 3. Code Organization and Refactoring
- **Application Plugin Modularization**:
  - Extracted helper functions to dedicated `utils` file
  - Simplified error handling logic
  - Consolidated duplicated code
  - Improved code readability and maintainability

- **Code Formatting Improvements**:
  - Standardized import formatting across server files
  - Removed unnecessary spaces in import statements
  - Updated code indentation for consistency
  - Improved overall code readability in applications plugin

### 4. Dependency Management
- **Package Updates**:
  - Updated `@typescript/native-preview` to latest version
  - Upgraded `arktype` to newer release
  - Updated `@playwright/test` for latest testing features
  - Bumped `@types/node` to current version
  - Updated `lint-staged` dependency
  - Adjusted `bun.lock` and `package.json` to reflect changes
