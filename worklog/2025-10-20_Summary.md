# Work Summary - October 20, 2025

## Overview
Focused on codebase cleanup and utility enhancements, removing unused domain architecture components and adding essential string manipulation utilities to streamline the application.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Domain Architecture Cleanup
- **Removed Unused Components**: Systematically deleted obsolete domain entities and infrastructure ports
  - Eliminated `pipeline-config` entity and all related tests
  - Removed `job-application-repository` port (unused)
  - Deleted `pdf-form-filler` port (unused)
  - Removed `pipeline-config-repository` port (unused)
  - Cleaned up associated use cases and test files across the domain layer
  - Reduced codebase complexity by removing dead code

### 2. String Utility Functions
- **New Utilities**: Implemented three case conversion functions with comprehensive tests
  - `camelCaseToHyphenated`: Converts camelCase to hyphenated-case for CSS classes and IDs
  - `camelCaseToSpaceSeparatedLower`: Converts camelCase to space-separated lowercase for user-friendly text
  - `camelCaseToSpaceSeparatedUpper`: Converts camelCase to Space Separated Title Case for headings
  - Added unit tests to validate all conversion edge cases
